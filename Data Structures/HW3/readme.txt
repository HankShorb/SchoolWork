EXPRESSION CALCULATOR by Robert Shorb (Hank Shorb rhs2131)

Calculates expressions as per assignment instructions.
Postfix expressions may be typed directly into postfix box,
they do not need to be generated from an infix expression

Works with negative numbers. Ignores words, (if a number is
appended to a word such as hello8, the entire string is
ignored including the 8). If an invalid infix expression is 
given, it will still convert it to a postfix expression, but 
if you prompt the program to evaluate this expression it 
will say it is invalid, and ask for a proper one.
