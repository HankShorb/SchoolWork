README - Robert Shorb (Hank) rhs2131

Unfortunately over the past few days there has been to much alcohol consumption
and too little coding. So the GUI is a no show for problem 1.

Other than that everything should be working pretty standardly.

Problem2 Main takes 2 command line arguments where you feed it the file location
of first the .txt file that contains the graph info and then the .txt file of the
dictionary you will be using.

I've assumed the size specified by Allen in the assignment for the number of words 
in the dictionary. If another dictionary were to be used, the size of the hash table
should be modified to reflect this.
